 ## Introduction  
  This repository contains the official implementation (in PyTorch) of the **Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)** proposed in the Interspeech 2021 paper [AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01778) (Yuan Gong, Yu-An Chung, James Glass).  
  
AST is the first **convolution-free, purely** attention-based model for audio classification which supports variable length input and can be applied to various tasks. We evaluate AST on various audio classification benchmarks, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results of 0.485 mAP on AudioSet, 95.6% accuracy on ESC-50, and 98.1% accuracy on Speech Commands V2.  For details, please refer to the paper and the [ISCA SIGML talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSRDbqGY0Vw).  
  
Please have a try! AST can be used with a few lines of code, and we also provide recipes to reproduce the SOTA results on AudioSet, ESC-50, and Speechcommands with almost one click.  
  
## Citing  
Please cite our paper(s) if you find this repository useful. The first paper proposes the Audio Spectrogram Transformer while the second paper describes the training pipeline that we applied on AST to achieve the new state-of-the-art on AudioSet.

## Geting Started  

Step 1. Clone this repository and set it as the working directory, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```
cd ast/ 
python3 -m venv venvast
source venvast/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
  
Step 2. Test the AST model.

```python
ASTModel(label_dim=527, \
         fstride=10, tstride=10, \
         input_fdim=128, input_tdim=1024, \
         imagenet_pretrain=True, audioset_pretrain=False, \
         model_size='base384')
```  

**Parameters:**\
`label_dim` : The number of classes.\
`fstride`:  The stride of patch spliting on the frequency dimension, for 16\*16 patchs, fstride=16 means no overlap, fstride=10 means overlap of 6 (used in the paper).\
`tstride`:  The stride of patch spliting on the time dimension, for 16*16 patchs, tstride=16 means no overlap, tstride=10 means overlap of 6 (used in the paper).\
`input_fdim`: The number of frequency bins of the input spectrogram.\
`input_tdim`: The number of time frames of the input spectrogram.\
`imagenet_pretrain`: If `True`, use ImageNet pretrained model.\
`audioset_pretrain`: If`True`,  use full AudioSet And ImageNet pretrained model. Currently only support `base384` model with `fstride=tstride=10`.\
`model_size`: The model size of AST, should be in `[tiny224, small224, base224, base384]`

``` 
cd ast/src
python
```  

```python
import os 
import torch
from models import ASTModel 
# download pretrained model in this directory
os.environ['TORCH_HOME'] = '../pretrained_models'  
# assume each input spectrogram has 100 time frames
input_tdim = 100
# assume the task has 527 classes
label_dim = 527
# create a pseudo input: a batch of 10 spectrogram, each with 100 time frames and 128 frequency bins 
test_input = torch.rand([10, input_tdim, 128]) 
# create an AST model
ast_mdl = ASTModel(label_dim=label_dim, input_tdim=input_tdim, imagenet_pretrain=True)
test_output = ast_mdl(test_input) 
# output should be in shape [10, 527], i.e., 10 samples, each with prediction of 527 classes. 
print(test_output.shape)  
```  

## ESC-50 Recipe  
The ESC-50 recipe is in `ast/egs/esc50/run_esc.sh`, the script will automatically download the ESC-50 dataset and resample it to 16kHz, then run standard 5-cross validation and report the result.
The recipe was tested on 4 GTX TITAN GPUs with 12GB memory. 
The result is saved in `ast/egs/esc50/exp/yourexpname/acc_fold.csv` (the accuracy of fold 1-5 and the averaged accuracy), you can also check details in `result.csv` and `best_result.csv` (accuracy, AUC, loss, etc of each epoch / best epoch).
We attached our log file in `ast/egs/esc50/test-esc50-f10-t10-p-b48-lr1e-5`, the model achieves `95.75%` accuracy.

To run the recipe, simply comment out `. /data/sls/scratch/share-201907/slstoolchainrc` in `ast/egs/esc50/run_esc.sh`, adjust the path if needed, and run:
``` 
cd ast/egs/esc50
(slurm user) sbatch run_esc50.sh
(local user) ./run_esc50.sh
```  

## Speechcommands V2 Recipe  
The Speechcommands recipe is in `ast/egs/speechcommands/run_sc.sh`, the script will automatically download the Speechcommands V2 dataset, train an AST model on the training set, validate it on the validation set, and evaluate it on the test set.
The recipe was tested on 4 GTX TITAN GPUs with 12GB memory. 
The result is saved in `ast/egs/speechcommands/exp/yourexpname/eval_result.csv` in format `[val_acc, val_AUC, eval_acc, eval_AUC]`, you can also check details in `result.csv` (accuracy, AUC, loss, etc of each epoch).
We attached our log file in `ast/egs/speechcommends/test-speechcommands-f10-t10-p-b128-lr2.5e-4-0.5-false`, the model achieves `98.12%` accuracy.

To run the recipe, simply comment out `. /data/sls/scratch/share-201907/slstoolchainrc` in `ast/egs/esc50/run_sc.sh`, adjust the path if needed, and run:
``` 
cd ast/egs/speechcommands
(slurm user) sbatch run_sc.sh
(local user) ./run_sc.sh
```  

## Audioset Recipe  
Audioset is a little bit more complex, you will need to prepare your data json files (i.e., `train_data.json` and `eval_data.json`) by your self.
The reason is that the raw wavefiles of Audioset is not released and you need to download them by yourself. Please refer to `ast/egs/esc50/prep_esc50.py` and `ast/egs/speechcommands/prep_sc.py`. We have put a sample json file in `ast/egs/audioset/data/datafiles`, please generate files in the same format. Please keep the label code consistent with `ast/egs/audioset/data/class_labels_indices.csv`.

Once you have the json files, you will need to generate the sampling weight file of your training data (please check our [PSLA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01243) to see why it is needed).
```
cd ast/egs/audioset
python gen_weight_file.py ./data/datafiles/train_data.json
```

Then you just need to change the `tr_data` and `te_data` in `/ast/egs/audioset/run.sh` and then 
``` 
cd ast/egs/audioset
(slurm user) sbatch run.sh
(local user) ./run.sh
```  
You should get a model achieves `0.448 mAP` (without weight averaging) and `0.459` (with weight averaging). This is the best **single** model reported in the paper. 
The result of each epoch is saved in `ast/egs/audioset/exp/yourexpname/result.csv` in format `[mAP, mAUC, average_precision, average_recall, d_prime, train_loss, valid_loss, cum_mAP, cum_mAUC, lr]`
, where `cum_` results are the checkpoint ensemble results (i.e., averaging the prediction of checkpoint models of each epoch, please check our [PSLA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01243) for details).

In order to reproduce ensembe results of `0.475 mAP` and `0.485 mAP`, please train 3 models use the same setting (i.e., repeat above three times) and train 6 models with different `tstride` and `fstride`, and average the output of the models. Please refer to `ast/egs/audioset/ensemble.py`.

Ensemble model 2-4 achieves `0.475 mAP`, Ensemble model 2-7 achieves and `0.485 mAP`. You can download these models at one click using `ast/egs/audioset/download_models.sh`. Once you download the model, you can try `ast/egs/audioset/ensemble.py`.

If you want to finetune AudioSet-pretrained AST model on your task, you can simply set the `audioset_pretrain=True` when you create the AST model, it will automatically download model 1 (`0.459 mAP`). In our ESC-50 recipe, AudioSet pretraining is used.
